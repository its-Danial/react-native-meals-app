## Meals app, made with react native typescript.

The app allows you to browse through categories of meals and then view various dishes in those categories. After selecting a meal which you find interesting, you can view its details such as cooking steps, ingredients etc. You can mark the dish as a favourite so that you can quickly navigate to it using the favourites tab located in the drawer.
